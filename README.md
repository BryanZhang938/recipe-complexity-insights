## Introduction

Food plays a crucial role in our daily lives, and cooking serves as a medium for self-expression—allowing individuals to expand their culinary skills and experiment with different cuisines. When browsing the internet or cookbooks for recipes, we often rely on reviews and ratings to gauge their quality. For those who share their recipes online, maintaining a positive reputation is essential as it helps them engage with a wider audience in the food community.

One key factor that food creators consider is the complexity of a recipe, which may influence how well it is received. In this project, we aim to answer the question: **Does the complexity of a recipe significantly influence user ratings?** We define complexity based on three factors: preparation time, the number of ingredients, and the number of steps required to complete a recipe.

To explore this relationship, we will analyze two datasets from *food.com*, an online recipe-sharing platform with over 500,000 user-generated and chef-created dishes. These datasets were originally created for a machine learning model that generates recipes, as highlighted in the research paper *Generating Personalized Recipes from Historical User Preferences* by Majumder et al. One dataset, `interactions`, contains a list of reviews for recipes on the website, while the other dataset, `recipes`, contains detailed information regarding the recipes themselves—including descriptions, ratings, and nutritional information. A more detailed description of the datasets is provided below.

### Interactions Dataset

| Column       | Type     | Description                                          |
|--------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `user_id`    | `int`    | The ID of the user posting a review.                 |
| `recipe_id`  | `int`    | The ID of the recipe the review is posted under.     |
| `date`       | `Timestamp` | The date when the review was posted.                |
| `rating`     | `int`    | The rating given to the recipe.                      |
| `review`     | `str`    | The content of the user's review.                    |
